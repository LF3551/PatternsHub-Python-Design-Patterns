# [Visitor Pattern](../) üö∂

## Overview üìñ
The Visitor Pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is ideal when you need to perform various unrelated operations across a heterogeneous collection of objects.

## Use Cases üîç
- **Processing Complex Object Structures**: Allows operations to be defined and added to classes without changing the classes on which it operates.
- **Adding New Operations**: Useful when new operations are needed frequently and without altering the classes on which it operates.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps related operations together and unrelated ones apart, which helps in maintaining code.

## Implementation üõ†Ô∏è
The `visitor.py` file should include:
- An `IVisitor` interface that declares a visit method for each class of concrete element in the object structure.
- Concrete `Visitor` classes that implement each visit method differently to perform specific operations on elements.
- An `Element` interface declaring an `accept` method that takes a visitor object as an argument.
- Concrete `Element` classes implementing the accept method.

## Example Usage üìù
```python
class Visitor:
    def visit_element_a(self, element):
        print(f"Processing {element.operation_a()} with Visitor.")

    def visit_element_b(self, element):
        print(f"Processing {element.operation_b()} with Visitor.")

class ElementA:
    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit_element_a(self)

    def operation_a(self):
        return "ElementA's operation"

class ElementB:
    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit_element_b(self)

    def operation_b(self):
        return "ElementB's operation"

# Example usage
elements = [ElementA(), ElementB()]
visitor = Visitor()

for element in elements:
    element.accept(visitor)
```
## Output üìä
```python
Processing ElementA's operation with Visitor.
Processing ElementB's operation with Visitor.

```
This output demonstrates how each element accepts the visitor and how the visitor processes each element differently depending on its class.

## Business Logic Method üß†
The Visitor pattern can be used to perform operations that require external state or complex calculations without changing the elements, which is especially useful in reporting and data analysis:

```python
class DataAnalysisVisitor(Visitor):
    def visit_element_a(self, element):
        # Perform data analysis specific to ElementA
        print(f"Data analysis on {element.operation_a()}.")

    def visit_element_b(self, element):
        # Perform data analysis specific to ElementB
        print(f"Data analysis on {element.operation_b()}.")

# Additional usage scenario
analysis_visitor = DataAnalysisVisitor()
for element in elements:
    element.accept(analysis_visitor)

```

## Testing üß™
The test_visitor.py file should contain tests to ensure:
- Each Visitor correctly interacts with different Element types.
- New visitor operations can be added without modifying existing elements.
- Correct data is processed during the visitations.
