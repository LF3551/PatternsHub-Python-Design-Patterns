# Structural Design Patterns 🏗️

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. These patterns help to ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system does not need to do the same, thus promoting flexibility and efficiency in the system architecture. 🎯

## Patterns Covered 📚

### 1. Adapter 🔄
The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by encapsulating one object and presenting a different interface.

**Usage**: Useful when you need to use existing classes, and their interfaces do not match the one you need. 🌉

### 2. Bridge 🌉
The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It involves an interface which acts as a bridge between the abstraction class and implementor classes.

**Usage**: Particularly useful in scenarios where an abstraction can have multiple implementations, such as graphical interfaces or database drivers. 🖌️

### 3. Composite 🌳
The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**Usage**: Useful when you want to build a hierarchy of objects where the components can be treated as individual objects or as groups. 🌐

### 4. Decorator 🎨
The Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. It works by creating a new object that contains the existing object and extends its functionality.

**Usage**: Useful when you need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects. 🛠️

### 5. Facade 🏢
The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It does not encapsulate the subsystem but makes it easier to use.

**Usage**: Ideal when there is a need for an easy interface to a complex system. This is often used in libraries and frameworks to simplify complex functionalities for the end user. 📐

### 6. Flyweight 🪶
The Flyweight pattern is used to minimize memory use by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It is a way to use objects in large quantities when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.

**Usage**: Useful in cases where performance and memory optimizations are crucial, such as in rendering detailed but similar graphics in games or other applications. 🔁

### 7. Proxy 🛡️
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, whether for delaying the full creation of the object, or to add a layer of security.

**Usage**: Useful when you need to control the access and management of a resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate. 🎛️

## Implementation 🔧
Each pattern is implemented in its own subdirectory within this repository:
- `Adapter`
- `Bridge`
- `Composite`
- `Decorator`
- `Facade`
- `Flyweight`
- `Proxy`

Each directory contains:
- Implementation scripts.
- A `README.md` explaining the pattern and providing examples.
- Tests validating the implementation of the patterns.

## Testing 🧪

You can run the test suite included in each pattern's subdirectory to ensure that the implementations follow the pattern correctly and meet the expected output. This is key to verifying that the structural enhancements do not compromise the system's integrity or performance.
