# Adapter Pattern 🔄

## Overview 📖
The Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two different interfaces by wrapping the one which needs to be adapted.

## Use Cases 🔍
- When you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.

## Implementation 🛠️
The `adapter.py` file contains the implementation of the Adapter pattern, including classes for Target, Adaptee, and Adapter. The Adapter uses multiple inheritance to combine the behavior of Target and Adaptee.

## Example Usage 📝
```python
target = Target()
print(target.request())

adaptee = Adaptee()
print(adaptee.specific_request())  # Client can't understand this

adapter = Adapter()
print(adapter.request())  # Adapter translates and makes the adaptee understandable
```

## Output 📊
```python
Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:
Target: The default target's behavior.
Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:
.eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laiceps
Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:
Adapter: (TRANSLATED) Special behavior of the Adaptee.

```
This example demonstrates how an Adapter translates the interface of the Adaptee into something that the client expects.

## Business Logic Method 🧠

Extend the Adapter pattern to handle more complex adaptations. For instance, integrating legacy systems with newer systems without changing their existing interfaces. Here's an example of extending the Adapter's functionality to accommodate additional requirements:
```python
class EnhancedAdapter(Adapter):
    def enhanced_request(self):
        return f"Enhanced {self.request()} with extra features."
```

## Testing 🧪
The `test_adapter.py` file includes tests to verify that the Adapter provides the correct translation from the Adaptee's interface to the Target interface, ensuring compatibility.
