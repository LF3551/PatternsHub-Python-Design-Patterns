# [Serverless Architecture Pattern](../) ☁️

## Overview 🌐
Serverless Architecture refers to a design where the management of the infrastructure is completely abstracted from the developer. Applications are composed of stateless compute containers that are event-triggered and fully managed by a third-party service, which dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

## Use Cases 🔍
- Applications that experience variable workloads and sporadic traffic, which makes traditional server provisioning inefficient and costly.
- Systems requiring rapid development and deployment where infrastructure management would slow down the process.
- Projects aiming to reduce operational costs by paying only for the precise amount of resources consumed during execution.

## Implementation 🛠️
The `serverless.py` file provides an example setup using popular serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions. These functions are triggered by HTTP requests, database changes, queue messages, or file uploads, among other events.

## Example Usage 📝
```python
# Example: AWS Lambda function in Python to handle HTTP requests
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Process the incoming event
    print("Received event:", event)

    # Return a simple HTTP response
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')
    }
```

## Output 📊
```python
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "\"Hello from Lambda!\""
}
```
This output represents a typical response from a serverless function, showing how it processes and responds to requests.

## Business Logic Method 🧠
Here’s an example of implementing business logic in a serverless environment:
```python
def process_order(event, context):
    order_data = json.loads(event['body'])
    # Implement business logic to process order
    result = f"Order for {order_data['item']} processed!"
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }

```
## Testing 🧪
The `test_serverless.py` file includes tests to ensure that:

- The serverless functions are triggered correctly by their designated events.
- Business logic within functions executes correctly and returns the expected outputs.
- The system gracefully handles errors and edge cases
