# [Microservices Architecture Pattern](../) 🧩

## Overview 🌐
Microservices architecture is a design approach to build a single application as a suite of small, independently deployable services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This architecture enables modular development, testing, and deployment.

## Use Cases 🔍
- Applications that require high scalability and flexibility.
- Systems that need to be developed and maintained by various independent teams.
- Projects where different services require different languages or technology stacks.
- Large applications that need frequent updates and rapid iteration without disrupting the entire system.

## Implementation 🛠️
The `microservices.py` file demonstrates setting up basic microservices, their communication mechanisms, and how they can be scaled independently. Commonly, microservices communicate using RESTful APIs or asynchronous messaging systems like AMQP or Kafka.

## Example Usage 📝
```python
# Example: Simple microservice for user management
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
app = Flask(__name__)

users = {}

@app.route('/user/<username>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(username):
    user = users.get(username)
    if user:
        return jsonify(user), 200
    else:
        return "User not found", 404

@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    user_data = request.json
    users[user_data['username']] = user_data
    return jsonify(user_data), 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

## Output 📊
```python
# User creation response
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

# User retrieval response
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}


```
These outputs show typical responses from a user management microservice, demonstrating independent service functionality.

## Business Logic Method 🧠

Here's how business logic can be encapsulated within a microservice:
```python
# Business logic to handle user promotion based on points
def promote_user(user):
    if user['points'] > 100:
        user['status'] = 'Gold'
    elif user['points'] > 50:
        user['status'] = 'Silver'
    else:
        user['status'] = 'Bronze'
    return user

# Applying business logic within the microservice
@app.route('/user/promote/<username>', methods=['PUT'])
def promote_user_route(username):
    user = users.get(username)
    if user:
        promoted_user = promote_user(user)
        users[username] = promoted_user
        return jsonify(promoted_user), 200
    else:
        return "User not found", 404

```
## Testing 🧪

The `test_microservices.py` file includes tests to ensure that:

- Each microservice functions independently and correctly handles its designated tasks.
- Services communicate effectively, maintaining data consistency and integrity.
- Services can be independently deployed and scaled.
