# [Event-Driven Architecture Pattern](../) 🚀

## Overview 🌐
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design pattern in which components or services perform actions in response to events. This architectural style is highly adaptable, scalable, and suitable for environments where events trigger multiple processes or actions. It is especially effective for asynchronous systems and real-time data processing applications.

## Use Cases 🔍
- Applications requiring high levels of responsiveness and adaptability.
- Systems that need to efficiently process real-time data streams or perform actions triggered by external events.
- Scenarios where loose coupling between components or services is desired.

## Implementation 🛠️
The `event_driven.py` file encapsulates the setup of event producers, event listeners, and the event bus or message broker. Here’s how the components typically interact:
- **Event Producers**: Components that generate events.
- **Event Listeners (Consumers)**: Components that react to events.
- **Event Bus**: Middleware that routes events from producers to the appropriate consumers.

## Example Usage 📝
```python
# Setup Event Manager
event_manager = EventManager()

# Register event listeners
event_manager.register_listener('new_order', handle_new_order)

# Simulate event
event_manager.emit('new_order', {'order_id': 123, 'item': 'Coffee'})

# Event handling function
def handle_new_order(event_data):
    print(f"Processing order #{event_data['order_id']} for {event_data['item']}")
```

## Output 📊
```python
Processing order #123 for Coffee
```
This output showcases how an event-driven system processes events, demonstrating the decoupling and dynamic handling of actions based on events.

## Business Logic Method 🧠
Here's an example of how you might incorporate EDA into complex business logic:
```python
# More complex event handling
def handle_order_shipment(event_data):
    print(f"Order #{event_data['order_id']} has been shipped.")

# Adding another listener for the same or different event type
event_manager.register_listener('order_shipped', handle_order_shipment)

# Emitting different events
event_manager.emit('order_shipped', {'order_id': 124})
```
## Testing 🧪
The `test_event_driven.py` file includes tests to ensure that:
- Events are properly emitted and handled.
- Multiple listeners can react to the same event independently.
- The system maintains robustness and responsiveness under high event loads.
