# Singleton Pattern

## Overview
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Use Case
- Managing a connection to a database.
- Configuring properties and settings for an application.

## Implementation
The `singleton.py` file contains a Python class `Singleton` that demonstrates the implementation. The key feature is that any attempts to instantiate a second object simply return a reference to the existing instance.

## Example
Refer to the `singleton.py` for a code example.

## Testing
The `test_singleton.py` includes tests to ensure that the Singleton pattern is maintained and that multiple instantiations return the same object.
